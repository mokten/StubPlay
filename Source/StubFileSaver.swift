 Saves a Stub in a two files.
 
 The reason it is saved in two files is that one file contains the request/response meta data and the second file is the actual content.
 
 This means no extraction needs to be performed and the file can be viewed directly in a compatible viewer.
 
 ie. jpeg can be viewed in a jpeg viewer
 
 1. Request and response meta data
 2. Response body ie. image, json, html, video
